## Management Commands

After installation, manage n8n with:

```bash
cd ~/n8n-[client]

./manage.sh start      # Start all services
./manage.sh stop       # Stop all services
./manage.sh restart    # Restart services
./manage.sh status     # Check status & health
./manage.sh logs       # View logs
./manage.sh logs redis # View specific service logs
./manage.sh backup     # Create backup
./manage.sh update     # Update n8n
./manage.sh uninstall  # Remove installation
```

## DNS Configuration

After installation, configure your DNS:

1. Get your VPS IP from the installer output
2. Add DNS A record:
   - Type: `A`
   - Name: Your subdomain
   - Value: VPS IP address
   - TTL: 300

Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation.

## Access n8n

Once DNS is configured:

- URL: `https://your-domain.com`
- Username: `admin` (shown after installation)
- Password: Auto-generated (shown after installation)

Credentials are saved in `credentials.txt` (permission 600).

## Worker Configuration

Workers process workflows in parallel:

- **1 CPU**: 0 workers (embedded mode)
- **2 CPU**: 1 worker recommended
- **4 CPU**: 2-3 workers recommended
- **8 CPU**: 4-7 workers recommended

## Resource Usage

### Minimal (1 CPU, no workers)
- n8n: ~400MB
- PostgreSQL: ~150MB
- Redis: ~50MB
- Caddy: ~20MB
- **Total**: ~620MB

### Standard (2+ CPU with workers)
- Above plus ~200MB per worker
- **Total**: ~1GB-1.5GB

## Backup & Restore

### Automatic Backups
If enabled during installation, daily backups run at 2 AM.

### Manual Backup
```bash
./manage.sh backup
```

### Restore Backup
```bash
cd ~/n8n-[client]
gunzip backups/backup_[CLIENT]_[TIMESTAMP].sql.gz
docker exec [CLIENT]-postgres psql -U [DB_USER] [DB_NAME] < backups/backup_[CLIENT]_[TIMESTAMP].sql
```

## Update n8n

```bash
./manage.sh update
```

This will:
1. Create a backup
2. Pull latest images
3. Restart services

## Uninstall

```bash
./manage.sh uninstall
```

This will:
1. Create final backup
2. Stop and remove containers
3. Remove volumes
4. Keep backups in `backups/` folder

## Troubleshooting

### Check Service Status
```bash
./manage.sh status
docker-compose ps
```

### View Logs
```bash
./manage.sh logs        # All logs
./manage.sh logs n8n     # n8n logs
./manage.sh logs postgres # Database logs
./manage.sh logs redis   # Redis logs
./manage.sh logs caddy   # SSL/proxy logs
```

### SSL Certificate Issues
- Ensure DNS is properly configured
- Check Caddy logs: `./manage.sh logs caddy`
- Verify ports 80 and 443 are open

### Connection Issues
- Check firewall: ports 80, 443 must be open
- Verify DNS propagation: `nslookup your-domain.com`
- Test locally: `curl http://localhost:5678/healthz`

## Security Notes

- Credentials are auto-generated and unique
- Basic auth is enabled by default
- SSL is enforced (HTTPS only)
- Database passwords are random 20-char strings
- Encryption key is unique per installation
- Regular backups recommended
